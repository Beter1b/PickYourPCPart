<p> First suggestion would be in a more budget option would be to get a Intel Core i3-12100f paired with any H610 Motherboard and a RX 6600 graphics card as well. The case is all up to the user and storage as well as the power supply. <p>

	For a more mid range build you would have more money to spend so the best option would be a AMD Ryzen 5600 paired with any b550 motherboard and a Nvidia RTX 4060. The other parts could be your choicing but the power supply needs to be a 750 power supply or more.

<body>
<div style="position:absolute; left:340px; top: 700px";>
   Since this is a high end build money isn't an issue so to go all out you would want to get a AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D with any X670 motherboard of your choicing alongside a Amd RX 7800 Graphics card the rest of the parts could be your choicing as well but power supply need to be 1000 Watts.
